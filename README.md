I made this little stupid status bar application in order to make it convenient to keep 
track of the current dollar exchange rate in my hometown [Bystrobank](https://bystrobank.ru) bank, there is no support for other banks 
and even other currencies in this bank. 

Also I have never written in swift so this code is rubbish.
